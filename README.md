# Card Battle Game *(Name Subject to Change)*

**Card Battle Game** is a **single-player tactical card battler** that focuses on **permanent progression** rather than roguelike resets. Inspired by titles like *Slay the Spire* and *Library of Ruina*, it combines deck-building and RPG-style growth with a unique **clash-based combat system**.

---

## Overview

Modern deckbuilders tend to fall into one of two categories — **PvP** (e.g., *Pokémon TCG, Master Duel, MTG Arena*) or **roguelike** (*Slay the Spire, Balatro*).  
**Card Battle Game** aims to offer something different: a **non-roguelike, single-player experience** where your progress truly matters.

Players will:
- **Build and upgrade decks** using cards earned through gameplay.  
- **Unlock new classes** and **level up permanently** over time.  
- **Engage in strategic, clash-based battles** where every play — and roll — counts.

## Gameplay

### Core Loop
1. Collect and build your deck with cards that have **unique effects and rolls**.  
2. Engage in tactical **clashes**, where your card’s roll determines the outcome.  
3. Upgrade cards and gain experience to **permanently strengthen** your deck and character.  
4. Progress through a structured campaign with a **set endpoint** — no endless roguelike resets.

### The Clash System
Combat is based on *Library of Ruina*-style **clashes**:
- Cards have a **range of possible roll values**.  
- When two cards clash, both roll within their respective ranges.  
- The higher roll **wins the clash**, allowing that card’s effect to activate.  
- Strategy lies in **timing, deck composition, and anticipating enemy plays.**

---

## Planned Features
- **Card upgrading system** expanded from *Slay the Spire*.  
- **Class unlocks** and permanent progression mechanics.  
- **Strategic single-player campaign** with handcrafted encounters.  
- Potential **optional roguelike mode** in the future as a side project.
